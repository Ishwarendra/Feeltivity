# Feeltivity

## WriteUp

‘**Feeltivity**’ provides you a platform on which you can hear songs of any genre based on your liking, but the twist is that you **don’t have to select the song** yourself. Instead, you can just **pour your heart out to our chatbot** based on whatever events are going on in your day-to-day life and the chatbot would in return **recommend songs according to your current mood**.

Our **target audience** includes each and every person who **loves to hear songs**, in spite of whatever is going on in their lives or in whichever mood they currently are in. Basically, if you like to hear songs anytime anywhere then ‘**Feeltivity**’ is for you! 

The chatbot uses **emotion and sentiment analysis** to configure the ratios of the different amount of emotions which are being depicted by the user based on what is written to the chatbot. According to these conclusions, we get to deduce the current mood of the user and based on this fact we will **recommend songs** of the **corresponding genre** to the user. 

We can also keep a **track of the user’s history** of what genre of songs the user generally listens to and accordingly recommend songs, as an addition to the content given to the chatbot. The user would also be able to see **statistics and graphs** based on the data that shows what genre of songs the user generally listens to or what type of emotion the user is generally in.

As an addition for **simplicity**, if any user doesn’t want to use the chatbot, they can also simply listen to any song they want by just finding that song and listening to it. 

So, our product would actually **easen the songs-listening process** of the user by getting songs recommended based on the user’s current mood and would also **save time** as the user doesn’t have to unnecessarily surf through a long list of songs or maintain separate playlists according to different genres.
